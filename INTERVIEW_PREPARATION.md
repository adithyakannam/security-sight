   - Responsive grid layout with incident player and list

2. **Incident Management System**
   - CRUD operations for incidents
   - Optimistic UI updates for smooth user experience
   - Error handling with rollback functionality

3. **Image Handling & Optimization**
   - SVG-based thumbnails for performance
   - Intelligent fallback mechanisms
   - Error boundary protection against infinite loops

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - React hooks optimization (useCallback, useRef)
   - Singleton pattern for database connections
   - Efficient state management

## üöÄ Problem-Solving Showcase

### Challenge 1: Next.js 15 Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Encountered `params should be awaited` errors after upgrading to Next.js 15
**Solution**: Updated all API routes to properly await params in dynamic routes
```typescript
// Before
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const { id } = params; // ‚ùå Error in Next.js 15
}

// After
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id } = await params; // ‚úÖ Fixed
}
```
**Impact**: Ensured compatibility with latest Next.js features and TypeScript safety

### Challenge 2: Infinite Network Request Loop
**Problem**: Application was making 2000+ repeated network requests, causing severe performance issues
**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Initially suspected React Strict Mode double-rendering
2. Investigated useEffect dependencies
3. Discovered image error handlers causing infinite loops

**Solution**: Implemented multi-layered fixes:
```typescript
// Fixed infinite image loading loops
onError={(e) => {
  const img = e.target as HTMLImageElement;
  if (!img.src.includes('fallback-image.svg')) {
    img.src = '/thumbnails/fallback-image.svg';
  }
}}

// Added useRef guard for useEffect
const hasInitialized = useRef(false);
useEffect(() => {
  if (hasInitialized.current) return;
  hasInitialized.current = true;
  fetchIncidents();
}, []);
```
**Impact**: Reduced network requests from 2000+ to optimal single requests

### Challenge 3: Optimistic UI State Management
**Problem**: "Mark Resolved" button showed "Resolving..." forever despite successful API calls
**Analysis**: Optimistic state was never cleared on success, only on error
**Solution**: 
```typescript
try {
  await onResolveIncident(incidentId);
  // Added missing success cleanup
  setOptimisticResolving(prev => prev.filter(id => id !== incidentId));
} catch (error) {
  setOptimisticResolving(prev => prev.filter(id => id !== incidentId));
}
```
**Impact**: Improved user experience with proper loading states

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
```sql
-- Camera Entity
model Camera {
  id        String     @id @default(cuid())
  name      String
  location  String
  incidents Incident[]
}

-- Incident Entity with relationships
model Incident {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  type         String
  tsStart      DateTime
  tsEnd        DateTime?
  thumbnailUrl String
  resolved     Boolean  @default(false)
  cameraId     String
  camera       Camera   @relation(fields: [cameraId], references: [id])
}
```

### API Design Patterns
- RESTful endpoints following standard conventions
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Type-safe request/response with TypeScript interfaces

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Database Connection Management**: Singleton Prisma client pattern
2. **React Optimization**: Strategic use of useCallback and useRef
3. **Image Optimization**: SVG assets with intelligent fallbacks
4. **Bundle Optimization**: Next.js automatic code splitting

## üé§ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: "Walk me through how you debugged the network request issue"
**A**: "I used a systematic debugging approach:
1. **Monitoring**: Added debug logging to track request patterns
2. **Isolation**: Tested in different environments (dev vs production, VS Code vs external browser)
3. **Analysis**: Used browser dev tools to identify the source of requests
4. **Root Cause**: Discovered image error handlers were creating infinite loops
5. **Solution**: Implemented guards to prevent recursive error handling
6. **Validation**: Monitored logs to confirm the fix reduced requests from 2000+ to optimal levels"

### Q: "How did you ensure type safety across the application?"
**A**: "I implemented comprehensive TypeScript usage:
- **Interface Definitions**: Shared interfaces for all data models
- **API Type Safety**: Proper typing for request/response objects
- **Database Types**: Prisma generates types automatically from schema
- **Component Props**: Strict typing for all React component interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Typed error responses for better debugging"

### Q: "What would you do differently if you started this project again?"
**A**: "Several improvements I'd consider:
1. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test coverage from the start
2. **State Management**: Consider Zustand or Redux for complex state
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live incident updates
4. **Caching**: Implement Redis or similar for better performance
5. **Monitoring**: Add application performance monitoring (APM)
6. **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization"

### Q: "How did you handle error states and loading states?"
**A**: "I implemented a multi-layered approach:
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback while API calls are in progress
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful fallbacks for unexpected errors
- **Loading States**: Clear visual indicators for all async operations
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Automatic state reversion on API failures
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/error states"

## üîß Technical Challenges Overcome
