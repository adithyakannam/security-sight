## ðŸš€ **Emergency Deployment Solution**

Since the Next.js build is having issues, here's a working deployment strategy:

### Option 1: Use the existing index.html
I see there's already an `index.html` file in the root directory. Let's update the netlify.toml to serve it directly:

```toml
[build]
  command = "echo 'Using static files'"
  publish = "."

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to Vercel"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and deploy it correctly

### Option 3: Simplify the App Structure
Remove the complex build process and create a simple React app that can be deployed anywhere.

**Which option would you prefer to try first?**

The Vercel option is likely to work best since they specialize in Next.js hosting and handle all the configuration automatically.
